# PyMastic
PyMastic provides elastic response of a pavement system under uniform circular load.
PyMastic has the ability to change the matrix inversion method to obtain more numerically stable solution. 
The number of iteration for Henkel Intergral to converge is flexible and can be tuned by user. 

## Validation examples
The PyMastic is compared against several well-esbailished multi-layer elastic programs such as WESLEA and Kenpave.
